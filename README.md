## Description

For this project, server side code for baseline functionality was provided for us by Prime Digital Academy. Each member of our team created a `pizza_parlor` database and took primary responsibility for one aspect of the `src` folder to focus on while supporting everyone in the group as needed. Our focus was using React, Redux, and Material UI to create a smooth interactive user experience and a seamless connection with the backend code that was provided.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Express, Node.js, Postico

### Installation

Fork and clone, and use the database.sql file to use to set up a local database. Run `npm run server` and `npm run client` (in two terminals).

## Usage

Usage should be intuitive: On the homepage, select your desired pizzas and click `Next`. Enter customer info on the page that loads next. The page after that contains the details of your order and a confirmation dialogue asking you to confirm your order. Once you do, your order will be added to the database and you will be rerouted to the homepage. If you go to `/admin`, you will be able to see all details of all orders in the database. Use the `details` button to view the pizzas on each order.
