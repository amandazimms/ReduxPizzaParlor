## Description

For this project, server side code for baseline functionality was provided for us by Prime Digital Academy. Each member of our team created a `pizza_parlor` database and took primary responsibility for one aspect of the `src` folder to focus on while supporting everyone in the group as needed. Our focus was using React, Redux, and Material UI to create a smooth interactive user experience and a seamless connection with the backend code that was provided.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Express - a web framework for Node.js Postgresql - an open source relational database

### Installation

Fork and clone, and use the database.sql file to use to set up a local database. Run `npm run server` and `npm run client` (in two terminals).

## Usage

Usage should be intuitive. On the homepage, select your desired pizzas and click `Next`. Enter customer info on the page that loads next. The page after that contains the details of your order and a confirmation dialogue asking you to confirm your order. Once you do, your order will be added to the database and you will be rerouted to the homepage. If you go to `/admin`, you will be able to see all details of your order.

## Acknowledgements

OUR TEAM IS AMAZING! Thank you to Jen Alexander, CJ Barnes, Amanda Zimmerman, Pete Stapp, and Miriam McNamara for navigating our first truly complicated group challenge together, and to our instructor Dev for all of his support throughout the process.
